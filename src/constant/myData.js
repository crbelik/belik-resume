        "Built websites to match each clientâ€™s unique needs, making sure the design and features fit perfectly. By working with Figma mockups, I crafted engaging layouts and used Bootstrap HTML/CSS to keep everything user-friendly. I also showed clients how to handle web hosting to maintain their sites, so they felt confident managing everything on their own.",
